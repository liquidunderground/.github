# Liquid Underground

Welcome, we're Liquid Underground! Our goal is to help independent
communities related to Sonic Robo Blast 2 by providing technology,
infrastructure and a helpful and inclusive community to guide them.

We believe in the independence and voluntary collaboration of every member
of our community such that we always strive to develop projects that put
*you* in the driver's seat. If you wanna know more about our principles,
read **The Zen of Liquid** down below.

## The Zen of Liquid (rev. 1.0)

This simple set of principles is meant to aid resolving conflicts and
ambiguities and guide every facet of the Liquid Underground community. It
may, but generally shouldn't be changed in the future to adapt Liquid
Underground into a healthy and inclusive community:

1. Illegal is out of the question
2. Reference is better than ownership
3. Useful is better than righteous
4. Expression is better than moderation
5. Public is better than polished
6. The project over the community
7. Distributed is better than organised
8. Collaboration is better than leadership
9. Independence is better than compliance
